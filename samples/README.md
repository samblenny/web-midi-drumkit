# Samples

[*note from samblenny:*] The text and links below come from
[/etc/samples/README.md](https://github.com/sonic-pi-net/sonic-pi/blob/stable/etc/samples/README.md)
in the sonic-pi-net/sonic-pi repository on GitHub, with some edits by me. The
original list of samples in the sonic-pi readme is much longer, but this repo
just uses a subset of their drum hits. I edited out text related to samples
that are not included in this repository. The general license for sonic-pi
source code is MIT (which presumably covers their samples README), and you can
read the full license details at
[sonic-pi/LICENSE.md](https://github.com/sonic-pi-net/sonic-pi/blob/dev/LICENSE.md).


## Edited README text from sonic-pi/etc/samples/README.md

Samples in this directory are from http://freesound.org and have
also been placed in the public domain via the Creative Commons 0 License:

Many of the samples have been slightly modified and trimmed for use with
Sonic Pi.
